        <h3>Welcome to Element Suite.</h3>

<p>Element Suite is a project to create an extensible security analysis application that provides support for distributed computing. Many security and utility tools exist which provide a variety of security tools; however, each tool has been implemented in a variety of ways and thus do not provide a consistent user experience. Additionally, the tools either lack distributed computing capabilities or do not provide them in a consistent fashion.</p>

<h3>What It Does</h3>

<p>The Element Suite project solves the user experience and distributed computing consistency problem with two distinct applications. The main client application, Element Suite provides a shell application with a set of <a href="http://bartsipes.github.com/ElementSuite/API%20Documentation/index.htm">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a> that developer may use to create a variety of security and utility oriented tools. The second application called Element Suite Moon may be installed on computers with available downtime such as in a computer lab to provide additional computing power for addins that are computationally intensive.</p>

<h3>How to get going</h3>

<p>First, take a look at the <a href="http://bartsipes.github.com/ElementSuite/Element%20Suite%20User%20and%20Development%20Manual.pdf">user manual</a>.</p>

<p>You can also just grab the project with the links at the top or by cloning the repo.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/bartsipes/ElementSuite.git
</code></pre>
