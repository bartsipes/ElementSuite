Many security and utility tools exist which provide a variety of security tools; however, each tool has been implemented in a variety of ways and thus do not provide a consistent user experience. Additionally, the tools either lack distributed computing capabilities or do not provide them in a consistent fashion.\r\n\r\n### What It Does\r\nThe Element Suite project solves the user experience and distributed computing consistency problem with two distinct applications. The main client application, Element Suite provides a shell application with a set of [application programming interfaces (APIs)](http://bartsipes.github.com/ElementSuite/API%20Documentation/index.htm) that a developer may use to create a variety of security and utility oriented tools. The second application called Element Suite Moon may be installed on computers with available downtime such as in a computer lab to provide additional computing power for addins that are computationally intensive.\r\n\r\n### How to get going\r\nFirst, take a look at the [user manual](http://bartsipes.github.com/ElementSuite/Element Suite User and Development Manual.pdf).\r\n\r\nYou can also just grab the project with the links at the top or by cloning the repo.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/bartsipes/ElementSuite.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Problems? Suggestions?\r\nReport it with [issues](https://github.com/bartsipes/ElementSuite/issues) or submit a pull request.\r\n"}
